# Week 5

Today there are two folders with sample code:

* We will start with the `groceries` folder
* We will then revisit the `movies` folder

**NOTE**: For next week, please install Node from https://nodejs.org/ if you wish to code along in class.

## Agenda

* A web page can often be decomposed into a grid of "components"
* Each component has its own state
* Each component knows how to draw ("render") itself onto the screen
* Each component can be initialized with an initial state
* Each component can handle UI events that occur within its boundaries

### The JavaScript Event Loop

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Event_loop
* To run a function "asynchronously", look at functions like `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`

### Maintaining Page State with JS

* Using the `Element.innerHTML` property
* Holding state
  * File-level variables
  * Global variables on `window`
  * Element-level variables using `data-*` attributes
  * Using JS classes and object instances
  * Using `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`
  * Using an external database or API
* Object destructuring syntax
